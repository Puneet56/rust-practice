Rust, a language born anew
Built to tackle what's old and new
A language crafted with great care
With performance and safety, a pair so rare

Rust, with its fearless concurrency
Unafraid of the challenges of modernity
Thread-safety and race conditions it can quell
Making it a language that excels

From systems programming to web apps
Rust's capabilities, the developer taps
Its syntax, both elegant and terse
Makes writing code less like a curse

With ownership and borrowing, Rust ensures
Memory safety, with no memory cures
A language that's got your back
Making it hard to write buggy code, in fact

Rust, a language that's here to stay
For those who seek both speed and safety's way
A language that's sure to impress
And put any coder's skills to the test
